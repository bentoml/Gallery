BentoML is an open platform that simplifies ML model deployment and enables you to serve your models at production scale in minutes

üëâ [Pop into our Slack community!](https://join.slack.bentoml.org) We're happy to help with any issue you face or even just to meet you and hear what you're working on :)

This repository is a collection of machine learning projects that utilizes [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)
for model serving. The goal is to demonstrate real-world BentoML usage and best practices in
productionizing a machine learning model for serving.

Note: You are looking at gallery examples for BentoML 1.0 version, which is still under early beta release. 
For prior stable versions (0.13.x), see the [0.13-LTS branch](https://github.com/bentoml/gallery/tree/0.13-LTS).


BentoML 1.0 preview release is required for running gallery projects here:

```bash
pip install bentoml --pre
```

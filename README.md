# BentoML Gallery

This is a collection of machine learning projects that utilizes [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)
for model serving. The goal is to demonstrate real-world BentoML usage and best practices in
productionizing a machine learning model for serving.

Note: You are looking at gallery examples for BentoML 1.0 version, which is still under early beta release.
For prior stable versions (0.13.x), see the [0.13-LTS branch](https://github.com/bentoml/gallery/tree/0.13-LTS).

BentoML 1.0 preview release is required for running gallery projects here:

```bash
pip install bentoml --pre
```

- PyTorch MNIST: https://github.com/bentoml/gallery/tree/main/pytorch/MNIST/

## Project layout

Each gallery project is under its own folder, typically containing the following files:

| file name            | description                                                                           |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| README.md            | a step-by-step guide running the project Python scripts from CLI                      |
| {PROJECT_NAME}.ipynb | a jupyter notebook shows the same workflow but from notebook environment              |
| requirements.txt     | required PyPI packages for this project                                               |
| train.py             | a python script for training an ML model and saving it with BentoML                   |
| import_model.py      | import an existing trained model to BentoML                                           |
| service.py           | python code that defines the bentoml.Service instance for serving                     |
| bentofile.yaml       | the bento build file for building the service into a Bento                            |
| .bentoignore         | files to exclude from build directory, when building a Bento                          |
| benchmark.py         | a python script that tests the baseline performance of the final model server created |

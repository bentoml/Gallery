# BentoML Gallery

This is a collection of machine learning projects that utilizes [BentoML](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML)
for model serving. The goal is to demonstrate real-world BentoML usage and best practices in
productionizing a machine learning model for serving.

Note: You are looking at gallery examples for BentoML 1.0 version, which is still under early beta release. 
For prior stable versions (0.13.x), see the [0.13-LTS branch](https://github.com/bentoml/gallery/tree/0.13-LTS).


BentoML 1.0 preview release is required for running gallery projects here:

```bash
pip install bentoml --pre
```


## Projects List

* Scikit-learn Iris Classifier: https://github.com/bentoml/gallery/tree/main/quickstart
* PyTorch MNIST: https://github.com/bentoml/gallery/tree/main/pytorch


## Project Structure

Each gallery project is under its own folder, typically containing the following files:

| file name | description |
| --- | --- |
| README.md | a step-by-step guide running the project Python scripts from CLI |
| {PROJECT_NAME}.ipynb | a jupyter notebook shows the same workflow but from notebook environment |
| requirements.txt | required PyPI packages for this project |
| train.py | a python script for training an ML model and saving it with BentoML |
| import_model.py | import an existing trained model to BentoML |
| service.py | python code that defines the bentoml.Service instance for serving |
| bentofile.yaml | the bento build file for building the service into a Bento |
| .bentoignore | files to exclude from build directory, when building a Bento |
| benchmark.py | a python script that tests the baseline performance of the final model server created |

Please note that this is just a basic folder structure that the BentoML team
recommend. However, you are more than happy to go at it and explore all the
potential possibilities with each of the gallery projects.

## How to create a new projects

We will use `cookiecutter` to generate a generic templates from our project
structure.

If you have `make`, just simply run the following in the gallery root:
```bash
make
```

If not, install the [requirements.txt](./scripts/requirements.txt):
```bash
pip install -r ./scripts/requirements.txt
```
Then run:
```bash
./scripts/new_gallery_project.py
```

Then check the [README](./templates/README.md) under `templates` directory for
more information on how to edit README in the generated gallery templates.

Before you create a Pull Request, make sure:
* Follow the basic structures and naming conventions of other existing gallery projects
* Ensure your project runs with the latest version of BentoML
